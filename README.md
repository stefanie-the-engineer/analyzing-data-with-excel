# Data Analysis Using Excel Spreadsheet
A spreadsheet with data from the KickStarter crowdsourcing application which holds information on a subset of the campaigns on KickStarter. Some of the information includes:
  Country
  Currency
  State (Success, Failure, Cancelation, Live)
  Start Date
  End Date
  Goal
  Amount Received
  
  Using this information, pivot tables, bar graphs and line graphs have been used to conceptualize the data. Most of the analysis performed are related to the state of the different campaigns hosted on KickStarter and how funding changed over time over a 1 year period.
  
  Also a Word document has been attached outlining some of the conclusions that can be drawn from the pivot tables and graphs, limitations of the data set, and other ways the data can be represented.
